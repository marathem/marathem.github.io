I am a PhD student at the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu) in the [School of Information](http://si.umich.edu). I am advised by Prof. Kentaro Toyama. I am interested in two broad areas of research: computational social science, and technology in socioeconomic development (ICTD).

I received my MS in computer science from the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca) in 2009. I completed my undergraduate education in computer engineering at the [University of Mumbai](http://mu.ac.in) in 2007.
